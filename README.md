Peregrine is a secure fast cross-platform client and server written in Rust. It supports desktop (Linux, Windows, Mac OS) and mobile platforms (Android, iOS). Is is made in such a way that switching implementations of cryptographic algorithms is a pretty easy process. Multiple clients can communicate using different encryption methods as long as both of them have all two of the decryption methods.
